## Background

Adaptive Parallel-Tempering is a heuristic method that can be used for optimization and sampling of a target function, for example an Ising model

The goal of this code is to provide a high-performance APT library that can be used in benchmarking emerging hardware, and also used in algorithm design for methods that require an underlying optimization and/or sampling method.
